# Set Compression Algorithm Analysis

## Overview

Design and implementation analysis of a specialized compression algorithm for integer sets,
focusing on achieving optimal compression ratios while maintaining data integrity.

## Requirements

### Input Constraints

- Data Type: Set of integers (unordered)
- Value Range: 1-300 (inclusive)
- Maximum Size: 1000 elements

### Compression Requirements

- Output Format: ASCII-encoded string
- Compression Target: Minimum 50% reduction
- Algorithm Type: Custom compression (no standard algorithms)
- Process: Lossless compression/decompression

## Algorithm Design

### Key Concepts

- Differential Encoding: Store differences between adjacent numbers instead of absolute values
- ASCII Character Encoding: Utilize ASCII character range for compact representation
- Sorted Data Optimization: Leverage ordered sequences for better compression

### Strategy

1. Sort input numbers to minimize differences between adjacent values
2. Calculate differences between consecutive numbers
3. Encode differences using ASCII characters
4. Include metadata for reconstruction

### Compression Analysis

- Expected Compression Ratio: 60-75% for sorted sequences
- Performance Factors:
    - Data ordering (sorted vs random)
    - Number distribution
    - Sequence length
    - Value range spread

### Implementation Notes

- ASCII encoding range: 33-126 (printable characters)
- Format: [metadata][encoded differences]
- Special handling for sequence boundaries
- Optimization for common difference patterns

### Detailed Analysis

- Differential encoding reduces storage requirements by storing deltas
- ASCII character encoding provides human-readable compressed output
- Expected compression ratio improvements:
    - Ordered sequences: 70-80%
    - Random sequences: 50-60%
    - Mixed sequences: 55-65%
